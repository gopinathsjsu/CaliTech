XP Core Values implemented:



Ishaan Bhalla  - Communication
Ishaan made sure the team kept in touch every week and communicated all the doubts and problems. He also worked at the UI and kept good deal of contact with the Back end so as to make integration as smooth as possible. Ishaan always kept the morale high of the team and made sure the work environment was productive ,fun and interactive, without him there would be a communication gap between the front and the back end developers. 


Raajmaathangini sreevijay - Courage
Mathu showed great courage in this project. She was not afraid to call out anyone who did something wrong and worked her way to the project with confidence and power. She worked in the back end and was very open about her abilities and skills and set real expectations among the team. 

Rakesh  - Feedback 
Rakesh assisted this XP core value. Throughout the project, he ensured that the workflow was smooth and everyone updated their journals weekly, he lead the weekly sprint meeting with great confidence and helped us with wonderful feedback. He worked at the back end with Mathu and they both had clean and non smelly codes.

Tarun Kasturi -Simplicity
Tarun had a nice and simple approach to the project, he was open about his skills and helped ishaan with the UI. He was honest in communication and delivered his code on time.
